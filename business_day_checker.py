"""
The script takes current date, 
forms a whole business day calendar from the ongoing month
and checks what is the fourth business day of the month.
Checks if the current date (today)
is the fourth business day of the current month.

EXAMPLE
Assume today is 16th February 2023
- the script checks that current month's fourth business day is 6th February.
As 16th February != 6th February, the script will not continue.
Had today been 6th February, the script would have continued
to execute the following commands.
